# Master thesis: The task of image retrieval in historical publications
Digitized historical publications (magazines, books, documents) abound in iconography (engravings, illustrations, photographs, diagrams). In view of this, a natural need arises to search for images that fulfill a given information need. The aim of this work is to develop a learning and testing set for the task of searching images in historical publications. The work will develop a prototype neural networks-based search engine. Images will be retrieved and recognized along with the surrounding text.
